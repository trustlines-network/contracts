Trustlines Smart Contract Platform
==================================

This documentation explains how to deploy Trustlines smart contracts,
for creating your own currency network and trustlines exchange. The
current documentation is written for an Ubuntu Linux system.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Python 3.6 or up and dev dependencies
-  `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__
-  git

Run
``apt install build-essential python3-dev python3-virtualenv virtualenv pkg-config libssl-dev automake autoconf libtool git``

One of the dependencies used is the secp256k1 library. If you're using
python 3.5 on linux you can skip the following step, since pypi contains
binary packages for secp256k1. If not, you'll have to run the following
to install the secp256k1 C library:

::

    git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git
    cd secp256k1
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --enable-module-recovery
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Deployment tools
----------------

This section runs through the tooling necessary for deploying the
contracts.

Ethereum client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To deploy the Trustlines smart contracts, you need an ethereum client,
e.g. geth or parity, which is synced to the chain you want to use. The
client needs to expose the JSON RPC endpoint. Additionally you need an
unlocked account with enough ether to pay for the contract deployment.

Deployment setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Download and install the solidity compiler solc into bin for
   compiling the contracts
   ``curl -L -o $HOME/bin/solc https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.4.21/solc-static-linux && chmod +x $HOME/bin/solc``

-  Clone this repository with
   ``git clone https://github.com/trustlines-network/contracts.git``
   ``cd contracts``

-  Install the deploy tool with ``pip install . -c constraints.txt``

tl-deploy
~~~~~~~~~

The tool ``tl-deploy`` allows you to deploy the relevant contracts.

Use ``tl-deploy --help`` to find out about the relevant commands or read
further in the `deploy documentation <docs/deploy.md>`__

Development
-----------

To start developing install the development dependencies into a venv
with ``pip install -c constraints.txt -r requirements.txt``

Compiling
~~~~~~~~~

The contracts can be compiled with ``populus compile``

Testing
~~~~~~~

For testing we use pytest with an ethereum tester plugin. The tests can
be run with ``python -m pytest tests``
